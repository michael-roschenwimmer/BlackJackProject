## Mike's BlackJack Homework Project

This is my week 3 homework project.

My program currently runs a basic BlackJack game with a preset dealer (Jimmmy) and
a preset player (Gus). The user controls the actions of Gus and decides whether or not
to hit, stay, or quit based upon the hand they are dealt as soon as they start the game.

The game itself checks for multiple conditions such as if the dealer or the player get
BlackJack, BUST, or PUSH. The game does not have options for using casino chips to bet
with and does not have the option to split or double down either.
